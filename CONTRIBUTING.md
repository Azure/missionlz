# Contribution Guidelines

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
[https://cla.microsoft.com](https://cla.microsoft.com).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/)
or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

Contributions come in many forms: submitting issues, writing code, and participating in discussions or questions.

## Issues

This section describes the guidelines for submitting issues.

### Issue Types

- Question: Ask a question about how the system works, ask for feedback on an idea about how the system could work, or you ran into something unexpected and you want guidance.
- Feature Request: Suggest a new idea for the project.
- Issue: Describe work that the team will do to enhance the product.
- Bug: Report a defect.

### Before You File

Before you file an issue, please check the following:

1. Check for existing issues
    - Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Azure/missionlz/issues) to see if the issue has already been filed.
    - If you find your issue already exists, make comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reaction-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction:
        - üëç up-vote
        - üëé down-vote
1. For bugs
    - Have as much data as possible, including any logs or stack traces, environment, and versions.
    - Steps to reproduce are essential for understanding how to duplicate the problem.
    - Provide clarity on the expected result vs. the actual result.

### Pull Requests

All contributions come through pull requests (PRs). To submit a proposed change, we recommend following this workflow:

1. Make sure there's an issue (issue, bug, feature request) raised, which sets the expectations for the contribution you are about to make.
1. Fork the relevant repo and create a new branch
1. Create your change
1. Update documentation where needed
1. Commit the code to your branch
1. Merge any additional changes from main into your branch and resolve any conflicts
1. Create the PR and associate it with the relevent issue
1. Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green
1. A maintainer of the project will be assigned and you can expect a review within a few days

#### Use work-in-progress PRs for early feedback

A good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a "Work-in-progress" PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of doing this is to add a "[WIP]" prefix in your PR's title and assign the **do-not-merge** label. This will let people looking at your PR know that it is not well baked yet.

### Use of Third-party code

- Third-party code must include licenses.

**Thank You!** - Your contributions to open source, large or small, make projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
