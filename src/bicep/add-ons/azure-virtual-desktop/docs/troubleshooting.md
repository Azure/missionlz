## Troubleshooting

If you need to redeploy this solution due to an error or to add resources, be sure the virtual machines (aka session hosts) are turned on.  For "pooled" host pools, you must disable scaling as well.  If the virtual machines are shutdown, the deployment will fail since virtual machine extensions cannot be updated when virtual machines are in a shutdown state.
