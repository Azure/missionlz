# SCCA

## Concepts

Mission LZ is intended to comply with the controls listed in the  [Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) Functional Requirements Document (FRD)](https://rmf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SCCA_FRD_v2-9.pdf).

The SCCA has four components:

- [Boundary Cloud Access Point (BCAP)](#BCAP-Controls)
- [Virtual Datacenter Security Stack (VDSS)](#VDSS-Controls)
- [Virtual Datacenter Managed Services (VDMS)](#VDMS-Controls)
- [Trusted Cloud Credential Manager (TCCM)](#TCCM-Controls)

Each component has a set of controls. The controls for each component are listed below, with a mapping to the technologies used in Mission LZ to implement each control.

- Some of the controls are implemented using Azure technologies, but are not within the scope of Mission Landing Zone, e.g. multi-factor authentication and AAD Connect. These rows do not have a ✔️ in the Mission LZ column.
- Some of the controls are not implemented with Azure technologies, e.g. BCAP 2.1.1.7. These rows have "N/A" under the Azure Technologies column.

> NOTE: the mapping of controls to technologies and Mission Landing Zone implementation represents our opinion on how Mission Landing Zone implements SCCA controls. The mappings below are not defined by any DoD organization or Authorizing Official.
